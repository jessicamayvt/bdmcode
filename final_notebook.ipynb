    "2. How many ISPs provide service in Tennessee?\n",
    "3. How many unserved BSLs are in Virginia in the latest version of each major release? An “unserved” BSL is one that does not have service exceeding 25Mbps download speed and 3Mbps upload speed from any ISP, ignoring ISPs that provide service to the BSL using any form of satellite Internet or *unlicensed* fixed wireless technology. They must also have either residential or “both” service and the service must be classified as “low latency”. Hint: you’ll want to filter based on technology code, download and upload speeds, business/residential code (values R and X), as well as the low latency flag."
